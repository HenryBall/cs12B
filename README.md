Introduction to Data Structures

pa1: Uses recursive functions to proccess and search a given array

pa2: Implements binary search to determine whether a specified file containes a target word or words

pa3: Creates a dictionary ADT based upon a linked list

pa4: Uses a linked list based queue to run a simulation of m jobs (a job encapsulates 3 quantities - arrival time, duration, and finish time) with 1 to m-1 processors. Jobs are initialized with an arrival time and duration and the finish time is calculated by running the simulation.

pa5: Implements a dictionary ADT based upon a hash table

pa6: Implements a dictionary ADT based upon a binary search tree.
